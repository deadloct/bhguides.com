# Standard Z11D4 clear strat for T13 DPS (Thiduna Conflux)

## Build

Raiju with associated mythics (T13 Titan WB). Offensive accessory (any mythic) and PREFERABLY offensive pet.

## Fams

Blinka or Drazig, most baits will work, like Oladus, Glarz, etc. and a tank fam. (This can be literally any tank...)

Oladus: Full evade, heals received more effectively bone, heal power chip or damage reduction chip. Can be cleared with any brain or without one but a defensive one (when hit) helps a lot. 

Blinka: Speed / empower pumps, SP regen bone, heal power chip, any brain.

Tank may vary, but there are many options such as Grampa Hef, Teithyus, Hebbo, Gello, even Ulairius works.

Preferably all legendary/mythic augments. 

## Strategy

Bosses: Truage, Flametalon, Mistral

For Truago you want your tank in back to absorb the 0SP. Two baits in front. Same goes for Mistral.

For Flametalon you may want to keep your tank in front, but might need to switch around a lot depending on the tank & bait.

I have a handful of videos on my youtube (if you search z11d4 it shows up) that show a few different clears with this strat: [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHpQl7TbewxI3c9kDcHdhrCyd8N3e9rkK&feature=shared](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHpQl7TbewxI3c9kDcHdhrCyd8N3e9rkK&feature=shared)
