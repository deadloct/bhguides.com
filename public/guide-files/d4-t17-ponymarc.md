# The Secret Leaf Clover Lodge in tier clear

To start off this was by no means easy, but with the right setup and knowledge this is not as hard as you may think, here is my first clear of the dungeon described below:

## Familiars

![Team screen for clover dungeon](/guide-files/d4-t17-ponymarc-team.png)

_Kimusaba+5 augments:_
(Not that important just some DR, evade or 100% block, the augments is not as important as Lerkys, use lady/your def pet to heal him and put yourself front for a while, if you dont have good augs for him, i did not have a problem with him dying or getting low HP)
I used two leg DR pumps and left the last empty bc i did not have a third one. For chip, leg DR when whole Team is alive. Brain, myth attack strongest when you get hit(heal and shield, is just as good). Bone, myth redirect (this is the one very important augment, leg or even epic will work too, the more the better, bc your Lerkys will be oneshot/hurt by most mobs in this D4)

_Lerky+4 x2 augments:_ (can be done with +3 and +2, gorobot just takes a lot more time to kill)
Lerkys Augments are more important, bc u need the dmg to 2/3 shot drillo before you and kimu die! For pumps i used 3x leg dualstrike(1 or 2 emp pumps can work aswell) For chip, myth %dmg -25% shields, (you dont need shield in these boss fights if u have enough redirect for gorobot they will rarely be attacked, and in the other bossfights shield do not matter. Other chips works aswell, like +dmg higher health %) Brain, myth(leg works aswell) attack strongest must have for Drillo! Bone, myth or leg First attack +chance is emp, or +dmg when over 75% health.

_Lady sparkin +2_ (just +0 works fine u need her for protection against attacks and sp)
her Augments are not important at all, i did something like 3 speed pumps, sp regen team chip, heal/shield per turn, and bone while at full health sp regen. (Her augments can be anything really, she is there for her 1 sp skill enhancement to give sp to lerky and herself, and the skill protection that heals and transform next instance of dmg received to heal, remember lerkys 0 sp skill have an dmg self so u destroy the protection if u choose his first attack)

## Sidenotes

(Front to back) Kimusaba, Lerky, Lerky, Lady Sparkin, You

This is the setup you wanna use for most of the dungeon, including vs Gorobot. For mobs and gorobot, you can change urself and kimusaba if you or kimu gets low HP.

For trashmobs the only one who can hurt you really is poiroton

![Picture of the familiar poiroton](/guide-files/d4-t17-ponymarc-poiroton.png)

This fella has shock attacks and can get annoying if u dont kill him fast enough, so focus this guy with 2sp shock 3 times target skill with lerky! 

rest of mobs are easy build up sp/protection/enrage on all ur team with sparkin. In the end try and use her protection skill on ur lerkys and urself,before the battle ends so you are rdy for a boss like drillo or trombo.

You can do the bosses in any order, in my clear i did trombo first, then Gorobot and last Drillo. But the ideal situation would be Gorobot, Drillo and then Trombolini, so u end up at the hardest part till last bc he kills all your fams most likely.

## Boss Strategy

a small note on my defensive evolvium, you choose the path block, evade, max shields and barrier

### Gorobot and Mobs

Setup for gorobot/mobs:

![Build for mobs and the boss, gorobot](/guide-files/d4-t17-ponymarc-gorobot-trashmobs.png)

(front to back) Kimusaba, Lerky, Lerky, Lady sparkin, You

4 piece torch, weave is required for this! you can use any mount for this setup, use a defensive pet all the way through. I used tattoi for 100% block setup with some block enchants/runes just as long as you hit 100% block, then it gets a fixed attribute and do not get affected by unlucky. Rest of runes and enchants should be DR, but evade or something else works 2. i had like 30% dr and 100% block with this setup, evade or other tank builds works here 2, just as long as you can survive with an redirect meta rune i had an myth one leg works aswell. Relic and artifact runes i used dagala for relic and nonik for artifact for all setups.

I used 11k stam can be lower if u want but one very important thing to do, is match this setup with trombolini setup, because when you change setup you will lose HP if the stamina stat is not close to, or the same value. You can do different HP but then you will need to waste your health potion to get full HP before trombo.

You just farm enrage from gorobot/trashmobs with torch set bonus 2/4 heal when Gorobot hits backline (you) Start by killing trashmobs behind Gorobot, he will always spawn in front in his encounter, when only Gorobot stands use lerkys first 0 sp skill and kill him takes a while sometimes. Use sparkin to give herself SP and heal yourself and the rest of the team if they get hit, when at the end just give everybody full sp with sparkin and move on.

### Pomp Drillo

Setup for Drillo:

![Build for the boss, drillo](/guide-files/d4-t17-ponymarc-drillo.png)

(front to back) You, kimu, Lerky, Lerky, Lady Sparkin

go all ur stats into attack, you need as low HP as possible so that one def pet proc can heal you close to full HP with a crit or emp. in the setup an off acc like fobett or ascendancy (any works with emp 2) exothermic jacket is a must! or else he oneshots your whole team, do redirect metarune or kor rune for better heals as most of drillos attacks hit weakest=you. But he has a target spell thats why I did redirect meta rune to be sure my lerkys werent hit at all. get 75 evade with witch set and enchants/runes, when 75 evade is hit, do rest of runes and enchants into emp.

when you enter this fight you will need full sp on both Lerkys, preferably proctection skill on yourself/kimu and full sp on sparkin aswell. you and kimusaba takes all the hits, hopefully you survive kimu redirects some of the dmg to him which helps you to stay alive aswell.

you and kiumsaba risk dying but, often sparkin gets a turn when this happens, and you can revive urself and kimu with potions, at least yourself needs to be alive to survive Drillo. When your sparkin gets her turn use 2 sp protection skill on yourself or give lerky sp if not full.

when the 2 lerkys gets their turns use enrage, and the 2sp skill that damages target and shock 3 times, if he is not dead after the 2 turns, you can often survive another round and get 2 hits again, thats why it is important to have 4 sp on lerky going into this battle, when he is dead clean up mobs and move foward.

### Trombolini

Setup vs Trombolini...

![Build for the boss, trombolini](/guide-files/d4-t17-ponymarc-trombo.png)

(front to back) lerky, lerky, kimusaba, lady sparkin, you

(i have tried many setups, both with exothermic jacket, fobett for better heals more HP, less HP the above setup had the most succes surviving trombo, but can be done with 75 evade and DR with offensive acc aswell)

Now it gets very frustrating, but with these tips you will do it better and faster than i did, bc i made all the mistakes XD (First off remeber that this setup has to be around same stamina as your torch/witch setup, i found out 11k stam was a good middleground, all gear into power can do it aswell, but you can get oneshot if trombo do a crit or emp.) The idea here is to let your team die and you outtank Trombolinis dps and get one turn and oneshot him with dracus, so you need this mount! (i used it on the other setups aswell bc i only have this one.) i described the path of evolvium in the side notes section)

With this setup you will end up with 74,5-76 evade 100 or 105% block and between 20-30 DR, depends on rarity of runes. you use elemtarium to get more defensive stats, i used 3x major myth evade runes 1x major myth dmg reduction. For meta you need kor rune for massive heals, for relic and artifact i used dagala and nonik, the only ones i had, other works fine 2. For enchants 2x myth 5% block and 4 myth 2,5% evade. How you obtain 100%block and 75 evade do not matter, mix and match  runes and enchants.

> **_NOTE:_**  This section will raise your surviving rate massively so READ this!

There is a handful of things to consider both during and before the bossfight! the first thing to do is try and make your kimu die/get low by trashmobs before this fight this is done by switching you redirect rune to something else, mby go for a pet that only heals you or an offensive one so that kimusaba do not get heals and shield, its okay if your lerky falls aswell but remember to kill the trashmobs before your whole team is dead. you do this because of Trombolinis brain augment, that attacks enemy team when you hit an enemy, Kimusaba got a lot of HP so you will die to true dmg of this brain, when trombo tries to kill Kimusaba. (sidenote i found out after 100 runs that Trombo had a brain aug xD)

full sp on yourself and sparkin would benefit you, at least 2 for your mount skill if you survive! and if you take out a trash wave of mobs beforehand remeber to use sparkin protection on yourself, do not do it on anybody else, because it lets trombo attack more of your familiars to proc his true dmg brain that kills you!

Now that your kimu is low or dead, we switch to the trombo setup, place yourself at the back, sparkin as the second from the back, this is because sometimes you will get lucky and she gets a turn, thats why you need 2 sp on her beforehand, so you can do 2 sp protection skill on yourself if you get that turn in with her. 

Now you just pray to the gods that you survive the next 50 turns trombo gets in before you and do the mount skill, and hope it oneshots him, one time i did not oneshot can happen, thats why off acc builds can work too by lowering surving rate, but raising the succes of a one shot dracus skill.

sidenotes: dwadin is not the best pet for this battle, Sqweeb is! this is because he shields self, and you need to outlive your fams when trombo hits you and his brain aug proc, this is why we need to kill kimu, because he has more stamina than us, if you have sqweeb u can be lucky and just go in with kimu at full hp, if u have sqweeb do this:

(front to back) you, Kimusaba, lady sparkin, lerky,lerky

Sqweeb and dwadin is the only pets i could make work with this boss!

Thats it, grats on being among the strongest heroes in t17!
