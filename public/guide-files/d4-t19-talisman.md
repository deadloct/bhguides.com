# Talisman's Broke Person Protoplague Guide

## Familiars

Winslar: (Any meatshield will do.)

* Pumps: Block x2, Barrier x1 (My DRs were on GlarzDos lol. Ideally run full Barrier I guess?)
* Bone: Redirect%
* Chip: Block% (Doesn't really matter lol)

Oladus:

* Note: My Oladus was +4 and I only used it because I don't have a third Glarz lol.
* Pumps: Evade x3
* Bone: While below 25% health, heals received are more effective
* Chip: Evade, -30% SP Regeneration

GlarzDos:

* Pumps: Damage reduction x3
* Bone: When below 25% health, heals received are more effective
* Chip: Gain DR while all teammates are alive

## Build

Protoplague with Clover and Ascendancy. Legendary mount with no power. (See Attached Pics)
Stat spread: 14,912 - 21,730 - 70,083 (106,725 TS)

Boat mount.

Runes:

* Major: Dual Strike x4
* Meta: First attack has increased Empower (a better choice would be While above 75% health, gain increased damage)
* Relic: % chance when you hit an enemy to reduce enemy team health
* Artifact: While at full health, gain Empower

Enchants:

* Empower x3
* Legendary enchants because I'm poor (try to get Empower, Dual Strike, or Accuracy)

## Strategy

* Use whatever skill you have the SP for that will hit the most times.
* Your attacks will randomly start a 45 second chain of 4/4 procs that will win the battle. Try not to fall asleep because you may disconnect due to inactivity if you do.
* Don't lose.
