## Notes

* Pet is set to per turn
* Kimu has atk team when hit
* Lerky has atk weakest

## Strategy

Protect 1st kimu then protect yourself then 2nd kimu and u want to keep that rhythm, and there are some occasions where u can use the fury skill on lerky 4 times (2 fury per lerky) where u could beef up their dmg u just have to watch bosses turn bar so donâ€™t miss a protect cycle.

And cause of lerky atk brain it makes quick work
