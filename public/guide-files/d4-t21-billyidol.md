## Strategy

- Start with full T21 stats, then swap to speed build.
- Success depends heavily on RNG; aim for runs with minimal enemy Porteriuz (ideally 1 port per mob).
- Avoid using Codex, as its skill may be triggered accidentally instead of 0SP or 1SP skills.
- Refer to Adhesive81 and Olivernoko's priority chart for targeting.
- See JDtheGreat's PDF guide for recommended Battle Text settings.

**Skill Rotation:**
1. Use 0SP skill to boost SP as needed.
2. Use Uxonium Lace Protect in this order:
    - Yourself (if just hit or unsure)
    - Familiars just hit and previously revived
    - Familiars just hit
    - Yourself
    - Tanks
    - DPS
3. Refill Lerky SP
4. Refill Kimusaba SP
5. Use Fury on target, alternating between Lerkies

**Lerky Skill Rotation:**
- *Destiny Chaser* (shock target 3x): Use against enemies with "per turn" brains; prioritize these targets.
- *Spark Stinger* (electric damage and drain from random): Use against enemies with "when hit" brains.
- If your team lacks Protect and you want to avoid triggering brains with shock EMP, use *Overdrive* on weak enemies with "per turn" brains.

**Kimusaba Skill Rotation:**
- *Armorwind* (damage furthest and shield self): Use against "per turn" brains in the back line.
- *Deep Wound* (damage closest and bleed): Use otherwise; having only normal damage hit prevents triggering enemy brains as frequently, and its true damage bleed is also helpful.
