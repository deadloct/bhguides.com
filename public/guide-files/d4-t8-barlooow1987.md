Bare minimum is to have a front tank with DR 75% and a healer pet ( i used drazig +4 ) but others have used walkom.

I think a must as a dps player was the shield per turn ring as it always gave a little to the supportive side.

Finally 1.2k speed was what made me able to beat it. When running 1k I lost everytime, those 200 extra stats made it so my ring proc'd more times and kept the team going

Rotated me with Drazig throughout the dungeon, focusing single target hit on Brimby, Gooz then Poke. Would try leave Winslow alive and just use normal attack to build SP and shields up for the next fight.

As for boss fights I did the same pattern as above apart from focusing the boss once. Those 3 mobs were killed first off even if he had a Winslow still alive I'd leave it and just focus main boss then try build SP and shields back up on Winslow again.
