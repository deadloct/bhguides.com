# Youreprettycute's In-Tier Pic and Text Guide

## Team:

*Bobodom +5*

* Brain: Attack strongest when hit
* Bone: Redirect
* Pumps: Evade
* Chip: DR the higher your health %

*Drazig +5*
 
* Brain: I switched between the myth attack weakest per turn and a rare spread heal when you hit (not sure which was used to clear)
* Bone: 75% more healing received when below 25% hp (Drazig was bait for my run, have some mobs that attack weakest, this kept Drazig alive)
* Pumps: Dual strike
* Chip: Healing power

## Build

4/4 Inferno, Engulfing Artifact ring, and Cometfell MH.

## Strategy

Prioritize healing over dealing more damage. Let Bobodom's brain do a lot of the work.

Speed was important, to get enough shields from the pet and ring.
