* **Pushes involve two main things: Boosts and Resources**

    * Boosts temporarily give increases to a combination of Item Find, Experience Gain, Gold Find, Movement Speed, and Capture Rate for a certain amount of time. _This timer decreases even when you're offline!_
    * Resources are consumables that give you currencies needed to play gamemodes, e.g. shards, energy, tokens, etc.

* **BEFORE you start a push:**

    * Ask yourself: _Why_ are you pushing? What do you want to get out of it? (Familiars? Gear? Weekly rankings?)
    * What boost(s) are you going to run? (Bitgor? Odagor?) Do you have enough resources to use the boost effectively?

* **"What boosts should I use for pushes? What should I use for regen?"** _(This may not apply to people with LOTS of boosts, such as whales.)_
    * Anything **over 500%** should be reserved for pushes.
    * Anything **under 500%** can be run on regen.
        * On most days, you can use Dailygor or Common boosts to accompany your regen. Common boosts are worth buying with gold from the shop; _NEVER_ buy rare/epic boosts with gems. You can get Epic boosts from the Boost Box in events.
        * I like to save **100%+** boosts for regen on weekends or events with boosted daily bonuses.
    * **350%** boosts (e.g. Cakegor) are in a strange spot. The general consensus is that you should use these for regen on specific days (e.g. Friday/Saturday/Sunday when there are doubled daily bonuses).

* **What boosts should I use to push each gamemode?**

    * **Raid**: Bitgor or Odagor (500% Item/XP/Gold/Move) for grinding gear. **DON'T** use a boost with >500%, as you'll go over the Item Find cap and the extra IF won't do anything. You can also use Capgor or Chikingor (900/750% Capture respectively, 500% Move) to farm familiars.
    * **Quest**: You can use anything, but there's probably no reason to use anything better than a Bitgor.
    * **T/G**: You can use any boost up to 750% (e.g. Kongigor) before you hit the IF cap. If you want to run a higher IF boost, run 4- or 3-token T/G to avoid hitting the cap.
    * **WB**: You will never hit the IF cap in this gamemode due to the low base item find, so you can run any boost you want. **This is the best place to use an Ultragor.**
    * **PvP/GvG**: The only stats you care about are IF (for more collars) and Movement Speed (to do runs faster), so boosts like Colgors or Sungors are best used here. You can use anything, though, as you'll never hit the cap.
    * **Invasion/Expedition**: You will never hit the IF cap, so you can use whatever you want, but you'll usually push these to farm gold or experience. **Invasion is the second-best place to use an Ultragor.**
