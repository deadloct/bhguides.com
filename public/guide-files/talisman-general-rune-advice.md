# General Rune Advice

- make Rare runes first, then save up for Legendary ones. epics are a poor use of materials
- the general consensus is to prioritize Minor (Diamond), then Major (Pentagon), then Meta (Hexagon). the triangle runes should only be focused on once you have what you want for all the other runes, since they are the hardest to get and provide (arguably) the least meaningful bonuses
- **Minor (Diamond Shape):** the best in slot runes are full experience. getting more experience allows you to level up faster (which is especially useful early-game when you'll want to make the most out of your energy, and your energy fully refills when you level up). additionally, getting more experience gives you more Guild Honour, which you can convert to resources (mainly Xeals) to get more loot! however, you can use runes that benefit whatever you need most. all options are good in their own way
- **Major (Pentagon Shape):**
	- NEVER make Elemental runes (e.g. Air Damage, Electric Resistance). the stats they give are not good to begin with, but they are much more expensive to make than regular Major runes
	- for a DPS, the ideal stats you want are Empower, Dual Strike, or Ricochet. Damage% and Speed% are still usable if you get unlucky with rolling. the other offensive Major runes are niche at best
	- for a tank/bait, the ideal rune depends on what's available to you. you would much rather have a lot of one defensive stat (e.g. Block) than a small amount in multiple. the best defensive stats are Block, Evade, and (pre-t12) Damage Reduction. (damage reduction becomes less effective after t12 due to Elemental damage)
- **Meta (Hexagon Shape):**
	- for a DPS, the best meta rune is Berthro (while above 75% health, deal more damage), but most of the offensive meta runes are pretty solid
	- for a tank, the best meta rune is Sol (redirect chance) for team content, and Kor (while below 25% health, heals received are more effective) for solo content
	- for a bait, the best meta rune is Kor (while below 25% health, heals received are more effective)
- **Relic (Upwards Triangle):**
	- for a DPS, the best option is Mull or Bonik (chance to reduce target/enemy team health when you hit an enemy, respectively)
	- for a tank/bait, the best option is Dagala or Wull (chance to heal/shield self when you get hit, respectively), but Boli is strong in some builds, notably ancient tank
- **Artifact (Downwards Triangle):**
	- for a DPS, the best option is Thork OR Othale (gain dual strike/empower while at full health, respectively)
	- for a tank/bait, there isn't anything particularly amazing, but you can't go wrong with Othale (while at full health, gain empower), since empower is great on tanks
