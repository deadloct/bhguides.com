# General World Boss Carry Info

- finding world boss carries pre-t9 can be difficult because higher tier players usually don't have a reason to run tiers that low (above t9, people may want mythics to make ancients)
- if you need to run wb regen for fusion materials (e.g. Demon Juice from Netherworld), you can solo a lower tier/difficulty, as fusion materials have a fixed ~1/20 drop rate that is unaffected by item find, tier, or difficulty
- if you're planning a big push in world boss, scheduling a carry in ‚Å†world-boss-lfg _before_ you use your boost is good practice
