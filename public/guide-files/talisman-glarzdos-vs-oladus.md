# Glarzdos vs. Oladus 
_(Reworded to be a bit easier to read and understand)_ 

**Upsides of Oladus:**

- Evade is better for d4s and things that you only need to clear once, especially in elemental content
- It can bait for Lerky while Glarzdos can't (especially important if you're a tank since you'll probably use Lerky)
- Evade is arguably a better stat than DR in content with elemental damage (see [https://bit-heroes.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics#Elements](https://bit-heroes.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics#Elements "https://bit-heroes.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics#Elements"))
- Avoids WB grinding, allowing you to focus your xeals on Teithyus

**Upsides of Glarzdos:**

- Damage reduction is arguably better than evade in content without elemental damage as it's more consistent, so I'd recommend it for T/G and invasion
- It can be obtained earlier than Oladus, which may be helpful to clear z10 and z11
- It has an arguably better stat spread for a bait, as Oladus' higher speed means it has less attack to work with when it procs brains
- Doesn't use raid fams, so you can run T10 raid for the familiar that Teithyus uses

**TL;DR: Both are viable, but each is better than the other in certain content. I'd leave it up to personal preference**
