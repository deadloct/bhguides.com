# Jdjdjid's Guide to Pushing PvP and T/G
_Courtesy of jdj, officer of ENM1 :)_

1. Observe your leaderboards every week (especially during pet/acc week) ((be careful during events - leaderborads tend to be higher)) - see how many points are needed on average to hit top1 or top2 (if top2 already gives leg pet/acc)
2. Hoard ticket rolls and token duffles. You would usually have to spend 30 at least. But be ready to spend even 50-100 or even more, when it gets more competitive, so always have backup
3. Calculate how many points you get from single battle on average and what is your winrate. In case of pvp you need to check what are your current max points (every time you get 4 random numbers, 2 at lower edge and 2 at higher edge, for example at t14 TS its ~5-6k to ~8.7k or even higher). Then check if you can beat the toughest enemy at least 90% of the time - if not, you will have to aim for lower points. Same applies to t/g - see what is the max diff which can be cleared without high risk to be defeated and calculate how many points you get from it (basically its diff * 5, as you always run x5). After you have all that info - you can easily calculate how many points you would get per 1 ticket roll or token duffle - they both give you 50, so you can run 10 times, which means that single roll/duffle will give you `<your average points per battle> * 10`, with adjustment on winrate - so you can compare how many of each you would need to hit top1-2 (based on observations from p.1)
4. Pet week is always when you have team of 5. Acc week is always when you have team of 4 - but t/g is rotated, so its trials x4, then gauntlet x4, then trials x4 and so on
5. You can take advantage of moving up tiers. As soon as you run pvp or t/g at least once - you are locked in you current tier leaderboards. It means, that after that one battle right after the weekly reset, you can beat the d3 and move one (or more) tier up - it will allow you to get more points per battle
6. If you decide to uptier after reset - make sure to invest enough rss in obtaining new tier gear - to increase TS for pvp and beat higher diff in t/g. Otherwise it would not make sense to do so

For pet (pvp)

- More TS = more points - get yourself full leg+ gear of current tier at +4

For acc (t/g)

- Higher difficulties are unlocked based on what d3/d4 you cleared (see [https://bit-heroes.fandom.com/wiki/TG](https://bit-heroes.fandom.com/wiki/TG "https://bit-heroes.fandom.com/wiki/TG")) - remember that those who cleared d4 in-tier have higher max diff available, so can get more points per battle
