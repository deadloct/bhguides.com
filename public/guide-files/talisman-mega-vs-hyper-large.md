# PSA: Mega vs. Hyper/Large
_(For people wondering which to buy after getting an epic pet)_

Opening a Mega Accessory Box/Pet Egg has a **21.3%** chance for a legendary pet. For the same price, you can buy 6 Hyper/Large Accessory Boxes/Pet Eggs.

- For each box/egg, the chance to get a legendary is 3.4%. Rolling 6 of these boxes has a **~18.74%** chance for a legendary pet. (See image)

HOWEVER, rolling 6 Hypers/Larges gives more Accessory Cream/Critter Jelly, which may be desired if you already have a legendary pet (or don't mind the ~2.5% difference in odds). TL;DR: If you want the highest legendary rate, buy Megas. If you want upgrade materials or a SPECIFIC legendary, buy Hypers/Larges.
