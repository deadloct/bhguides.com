# What Pumps Should I Hold Onto when Rolling Legendaries?

In general, these are the pump augments that are worth holding onto (and the major familiars you want them for):

- Damage Reduction: Glarzdos
- Deflect: Ularius
- Evade: Oladus, Teithyus
- Empower, dual strike, ricochet: General DPS/support
- Speed: General support
- Block: I can't think of any non-event fams rn but it's worth holding onto, especially pre-Teithyus
- Barrier: General tank (notably Kimusaba)
