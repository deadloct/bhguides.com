# Earlygame - "What should I use my regen on?"
_(Some of this may not apply for pushes)_

* Use your **Energy** (Quest) to work on your familiars.

    * The familiars you'll be farming will vary depending on your tier.
    * Note that whenever you level up, your Energy is fully restored. If you have a lot of energy and are about to level up, I recommend converting the extra energy into shards so that they aren't wasted.

* Use your **Shards** (Raid) to farm gear.

    * Farm the highest tier raid available, unless you really need a raid familiar for a fusion. In earlygame, you will not need raid familiars.
    * **Avoid using legendaries or sets until Tier 9+.** They are much more expensive than epic gear, and are not needed to progress. Use fully upgraded epic gear instead.
    * **Avoid using mythic gear until you're well into midgame.** They are very expensive to upgrade, and earlygame mythics are not worth the effort. They provide the same base stats as legendaries. The first mythic I would recommend actively farming for is Kaijin Tear in T13.
    * Upgrade mythic gear to +1 before melting to get more legendary materials. This ONLY works for mythic gear.

* Use your **Tickets** (PvP) daily to get points for weekly event rewards. This will help you get materials to make Augments and Runes, and upgrade your pet/accessory.

* Use your **Tokens** (T/G) to run the highest difficulty Trial/Gauntlet you can reliably complete to get gear and points for weekly event rewards.

* Use your **Badges** (GvG/Expedition/Invasion) to run whatever weekly event is in rotation. You'll need to be in a guild to run GvG and Expedition.

    * Exped and Invasion are good sources of XP and gold, and can give gear. GvG gives similar rewards to PvP. All three also have weekly event rewards.

* Use your **Xeals** (World Boss) to run whatever boss tier you can solo, unless you can find a carry. Carries may be difficult to find in lower tiers.

    * If you need a WB fusion (e.g. Omo), you can run low-tier world boss to farm the materials you need. WB fusion mats (e.g. Demon Juice from Netherworld) and schematics are NOT affected by tier, so you can solo T3 Heroic on regen to get what you need.

* Save resource consumables (consumables that give shards, energy, etc) for planned pushes! Don't use them on regen.
