# Why Ularius > Shrampz

Ula has less health than Shrampz but has three upsides that make it better to use:

1. Deflect allows you to cheese the hard-hitting bosses from t7 to t9, of which there are MANY
2. Since it's an epic familiar, augments you put on it are stronger
3. Having a bit more attack lets it do more with its brain augment and Drain skill
